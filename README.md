Black Chalkboard is a back office web tool to enhance the knowledge and experience of your teaching staff. Here, you can create a database of the students in your school and to include all the necessary details a teacher would need to provide the best learning experience.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, EJS, Node, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap

## Optimizations

As I see it now, I plan to add an edit and search feature to enhance the User Experience and make the application even more intuitive for clients.

## Takeways/New Lessons

This was a heavy project utilizing the Full-Stack Experience. It has helped to ensure that I can do this at a level I would have never imagined. I am preparing for more projects that I can present to businesses and clients for use.
